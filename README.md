# Dice-game 

This is a very simple dice game for two players. You have to just refresh the page. 

Suppose you are player 1 and your friend is player 2. 

When you refresh the page, both dice will change and give you the result, and the result will gets updated(Player 1 win or player 2 win). 

If both dice will came same, match will tie. This project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Dom Manipulation. 

We manipulate images of dice and text(heading) with dom and generated random number using javascript.
